The United States Blind Chess Association (USBCA) works to encourage
and assist in the promotion and advancement of correspondence and
over-the-board chess among chess enthusiasts who are blind or visually
impaired.

It is the generosity of our donors that enables the USBCA to carry out
our mission. Your support, at any level, enables us to: run
correspondence tournaments, organize and conduct an annual
over-the-board tournament, spread the word about the USBCA to
individuals who are blind or visually impaired and provide tactile chess
sets to new members.

To donate to the USBCA, feel free to [contact us](/contact).
