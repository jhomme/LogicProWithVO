<p>The USBCA experienced a very sad loss with the passing of long time member and
friend, Norm Doerner. Jim Thoune, USBCA President, conveyed the sad news on
August 20, 2023 that Norm had passed away the day before. Jim provided a
beautiful sentiment when he stated, ‘We have lost a good friend and a fine human
being. Maybe we can picture him sitting at a great chess board in the sky. I
think he’d like that.” Drawing from Lou Gehrig, Norm himself so eloquently
stated, ‘I’m the luckiest man in the world. I have chess and such good chess
friends.”. I think Marilyn Bland spoke for many when she said, “In my heart I’ll
be playing the revival tournament for Norm.” Requiescat in Pace. RIP Norm.</p>
<h2 id="editor39s-note">Editor's Note</h2>
<p>by David Rosenkoetter</p>
<p>Chess is all about tension. Tense moments make us sweat as the final seconds
tick away before someone's flag falls. Tense positions hold in a center
where the
tiniest pawn break may signal the breakthrough of white's rooks or
black's success in plugging the gap in her defense. Tension brews to the
surface as a Tournament Director edges his way to the table where competitors
ask questions about whether a draw has occurred or if play must go on. Tension
rises in the rhythmic breathing as competitors survey the board looking for that
clinching, winning combination. And tension releases when the game ends followed
by the postmortem analysis. So, as we analyze easy to hard puzzles, we look for
those ways tension is resolved. When looking at our player spotlight, we may
wonder how he or she performs at their best under tension. We analyze the
winning game from this year's U.s. Blind Open and Paul Benson's Champing
At the Bit Part 2. We rejoice with the winners of tournaments held over the
summer and prepare thoroughly for the tournaments ahead. Yes, my friends, we had
champions this summer as Mario Montalvo took first and Alex Barrasso took second
in the USBCA's first USCF rated online event, the Jim Slagle Tribute
Tournament. The crown was passed from Jessica Lauser to Alex Barrasso as
champion of this year's U.S. Blind Open held in Elmhurst, IL. Under the
direction of our new USBCA tournament director, Jim Homme, we will crown many
more champions in the months to come as the Norm Dorner Memorial Correspondence
Tournament is well underway. Once again this year, Jessica Lauser and Marilyn
Bland will represent the United States in the Pan-American Games to be held in
Guatemala. In the following pages, let the tension ride! Let it drive you to
deep analysis and appreciation of the games we have in store. Rejoice with Alex
Barrasso's spotlight interview with Glenn Crawford. Consider what our USBCA
President, Jim Thoune, has for us in his perspective. Here is the September,
2023 edition of Challenger!</p>
<h2 id="president39s-message-the-usbca-who-am-us-anyway-the-firesign-theater">President's Message: The USBCA! Who Am Us, anyway! (The Firesign Theater)</h2>
<p>by Jim Thoune</p>
<p>It seems a reasonable question to ask. As your President, to serve
as your President, it seems perhaps the thing I should be most attuned to, does
it not? As I consider the question, I find myself vocalizing the phrase
&quot;grass roots.&quot; Don't get me wrong, this is not necessarily a bad
tag, but I believe it is a telling tag. I think it can help us to gain some
perspective on some of the events of the past few months. I also hope and
believe it can help us gain a perspective needful to help us heal and move on
productively.</p>
<p>For the first 14 or 15 years, basically 1968 through 1982, the
USBCA was actively involved with not only the correspondence tournaments which
Gintas Burba used to run, RIP Gintas! The organization was also a part of
assisting players with reaching foreign sites for IBCA events. That changed in
the 1980's; I'm not sure why. We continued to have our annual
over-the-board (OTB) event, and we had some pretty excellent turn out,
consistently around 25 players, give or take. We played different venues. I
personally attended tournaments in Findlay, Ohio as well as San Antonio, Texas.
The venue change didn't seem to adversely impact the number of participants.
Folks showed up, said &quot;Howdy&quot; and &quot;Hey&quot; to friends and
acquaintances they hadn't seen in a year. It was fun! It was five rounds of
some pretty good chess! It was generally marked by &quot;Glad to see you&quot;
and &quot;See you next year!&quot;</p>
<p>Then, the internet happened. Aaah, the
internet. Email. Skype. Over-the-board attendance figures began to drop, despite
the fact that the number of participants in both Correspondence and real time
play increased. True, we were aging. Many of the players I remember
corresponding with back in the 70's and 80's have either died or retired
from chess. This is to be expected. But, the number of people willing and able
to travel to a site to play chess for a weekend has not kept up with the numbers
gravitating to the ease and comfort of using the various online capabilities to
play chess. Can we rectify this? Do we need to rectify this?</p>
<p>To answer the second question first, I'm sure that we do not need to alter
the tide of movement toward online activity. Online resources far surpass what
we as blind players had access to in the past. This is a good thing. In fact,</p>
<p>the only element that concerns me has to do with the turn out for our OTB
Championship tournament over the last four years. In 2019, we seemed to turn a
corner. Attendance, which had been in the single digits for more than ten years,
suddenly hit double figures. We even had our first visit from a player younger
than 20 years old. Nathaniel Figueroa was ten years old when he attended our
2019 OTB tournament. Then, of course, COVID hit. The whole universe changed. As
we gear up for another winter and another predicted upsurge of COVID, we are
still struggling with how to roll with the punches. The USBCA is rolling.</p>
<p>Perhaps you thought I would say &quot;reeling,&quot; given the purely
reprehensible events of June of this year. And indeed, what took place during
June and into July made it clear that we had to take steps to ensure that such a
chain of events could not happen again. Steps are already in progress. Though
the organization has existed for over 50 years and changed fairly substantially
over the last 15 or so, the Bylaws haven't had the same attention. I have
already established a committee to work on bringing the Bylaws up-to-date.
Proposed amendments will be circulated throughout the membership for
ratification or rejection. The USBCA exists of, by, and for its members.</p>
<p>It was pointed out to me, recently, that we have not been especially transparent to our
membership. Minutes of our Board meetings will begin appearing on our website as
soon as our webmaster can accommodate it.</p>
<p>While one of the functions of the
USBCA is to encourage players to participate in international events, we are not
even incorporated as a non-profit, let alone established as a 501(C)3 entity
capable of actively raising funds to help members. Application to acquire
non-profit status is in the works and will be a reality before the end of the
year.</p>
<p>While the USBCA has run numerous tournaments over the years, and will
continue to do so, until this year, those tournaments have not been sanctioned
by nor even recognized by the US Chess Federation. The USBCA is now working
closely with the USCF to have our tournament directors certified. This means
that we can run club tournaments, and have them rated, just like any mainstream
club in the country. This means that for some of our tournaments, participants will have to belong to the US
Chess Federation. Don't worry, those of you who have no interest in
belonging to the USCF, we will still have tournaments open to anyone, regardless
of USCF affiliation. But, one of our objectives is to promote chess among blind
people. This doesn't mean that we settle for merely social activities
exclusively for and within the &quot;blind community.&quot; We need to be a
functioning organization not only on a social level but also capable of serving
those who aspire to compete in a mainstream environment.</p>
<p>This year, we held our
first USCF-rated tournament online to honor and to celebrate the contributions
and achievements of one of the USBCA founders, Jim Slagle, who has worked and
competed in the mainstream world throughout his life.</p>
<p>This year, thanks to
donations from two anonymous donors, we are holding our first event, a
Correspondence tournament, with a cash prize fund. That is only a partial list
of the ways that the USBCA is changing and growing.</p>
<p>So, who am us, anyway? We
are all of us, whomever you are. We are not just the seven current Board
members, a number planned to grow to nine. We are the sum total of all those who
care to be a part of us. We are a vehicle engaged in providing a safe,
supportive environment in which anyone who wishes to can learn, study, and play
chess. And we are a learning, growing organization dedicated to protecting said
environment to the best of our collective ability.</p>
<p>James Thoune, President,
USBCA</p>
<h2 id="player-spotlight-us-blind-open-champion-alex-barrasso">Player Spotlight, U.S. Blind Open Champion Alex Barrasso</h2>
<p>By Glenn Crawford</p>
<p>Alex Barrasso, Board Member of the United States Blind Chess Association (USBCA)
and a member since 1992, is the U.S. blind chess champion for 2023. The
tournament was sponsored by U.S. Chess and hosted by Caveman Chess. There was a
prize fund of $4,000. First, second, third, and fourth place finishers earned
$1,000, $800, $500, and $300 respectively. There were also several divisional
cash prizes. Alex finished in first place with a score of five wins and one draw
after playing six rounds in a Swiss style competition with a 90/30 time control.</p>
<p>The contest was held in the Frick Center at Elmhurst University in Elmhurst,
Illinois from July 21 through July 23 of this year. Our board member, who lives
in Washington DC with his wife and two children, flew to the tournament from
Reagan International Airport in Arlington, Virginia. He has had service dogs in
the past, but currently has none and uses the white cane method of navigation. At
the Frick Center he said those with no usable sight needed to rely on someone
with vision to help him and others locate facilities. The room accommodations
comprised a suite of three bedrooms, one for each player, and a shared bathroom.</p>
<p>Jessica Lauser, a dorm mate of Alex and David Rosenkoetter, has some vision and
helped him and David get around. Their rooms and playing areas were in different
buildings. Jessica helped them with such things as getting them to the sites and
with getting trays and food in the cafeteria. He said they would have been
really lost without her.</p>
<p>At the tournament, Alex's draw was with Donald
Crosswhite. During this game, the soon to be U.S. blind chess champion started
to get into time difficulty. With about sixteen minutes left on his clock, he
said he began to panic. &quot;I let the clock get to my head and affect my play.
And, I made some incredibly elementary endgame mistakes. I was lucky to
draw.&quot;</p>
<p>In a subsequent game with Jessica, he also got into time trouble.
&quot;I had about ten minutes left, so less time than I had in the last game
[with Donald].&quot; He continued, &quot;She offered me a draw and I said [to
myself] you know what? I can't
do what I did last time and let this clock get to me. I've got to play this
out and try to win it. And, I did.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex, who has been blind from birth,
learned to play chess at age eleven. He was introduced to the game at a birthday
party for a friend. The guest of honor was a member of his school's chess
club, and someone suggested playing the game. Alex knew nothing about chess and
felt lost when others began to play. The birthday boy's father noticed his
plight and took him aside to explain the pieces and moves associated with them,
giving him his first taste of the world's greatest board game. This kind man
contacted the chess coach at his son's school who located an adaptive set
for Alex and took him on as a member of the chess club.</p>
<p>Alex continued through his educational years to play on the chess clubs of the
different schools he attended. He became a member of US Chess and, by the
early 1990s, attained a rating of over 1700.</p>
<p>Alex prefers real time games over
those played by correspondence. &quot;I have a strong preference for setting
aside a bulk of time, whether it is a week, a weekend, whatever it is, going to

<p>When not playing chess, Alex spends his time with
work and family. He is employed at the U.S. State Department in the foreign
service. Between 2007 and 2021, he and his family were overseas in many
countries, including Thailand, Brunei, The Czech Republic, and Saudi Arabia. He
is a foreign service officer. His area of expertise is what he describes as the
political cone or political arena. &quot;The nuts and bolts of my job usually
revolve around getting the political backstory in whatever country I am in and
then providing some analysis of what the events mean for U.S. foreign policy and
communicating all of that to Washington.&quot; He gets the backstory from
sources in the host government, journalists, activists, NGOs, counterparts in
the host nation's military, religious organizations, and anyone else who is
willing to talk with him.</p>
<p>Given his life of world travel, Alex enjoys being a board member of the USBCA
whose members are moving more toward international games with Marilyn Bland
competing in the women's world championship and she and Jessica playing in
the Pan Am games. He says funding for these activities is challenging. But, when
the USBCA becomes a 501c(3) nonprofit organization, opportunities for members to
compete globally will be easier to achieve. &quot;I very much favor us as an
organization supporting those players who want to compete internationally.&quot;</p>

<p>Here we shall examine a Grand Master with white vs
a 20 years old International Master with black. This almost 300 Elo point
difference offers a classic &quot;Goliath vs David&quot; clash. Clearly white
expects to win, black probably hoping for a draw. Best laid plans&hellip;</p>

<p>White cannot save this but there are always tricks to try, here is a specific
formation worthy of mention. Imagine black marches the king back to the kingside
to assist the shuffling forward of the passed pawns. If this idea appeals, there
is a self-trap to avoid. Placing the rook on the black 7th rank, say b2 or c2,
is fine, but beware that advancing a pawn to h2 with the white king on h1 throws
it all away. The white king would be in stalemate if white had no rook, which
gives that rook the opportunity to chase the black king with checks,
irrespective of the safety of the rook, white wants to give it away. Handled
correctly, some careful dancing is required at times, the rook can give a
perpetual check until white concedes it cannot be won.)</p>

between the old and the new champion and builds to a tense finish.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>These are all moves that I would expect to see in a Philidor's or several
other double King's Pawn openings. The main feature is that the advance of
the a7- Pawn means Black isn't castling Queenside, so where is the Black
King going?</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This sets the tone for the game. Jessica wants to attack on the Kingside. In
reply Alex swaps Pawns on e5 and attempts to play through the centre and on the
Queenside, the classic counter to enemy play on the wing.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is quite deep stuff. On the face of it it's so easy to say that White
should play
16. Rad1 here instead. However, Alex clearly intends to follow up with Bf1 to
bolster his Kingside so that's why it's this Rook.</p>
<p>Okay, so why not put this Rook on e1 instead you may ask? Well, there's
already a certain looseness to the White Kingside and the White Queen and a Rook
on e1 make a tempting target for a potential &hellip;Be7-h4 later on. Yes, White can
answer g2-g3 but what about the White Pawn on h3? Hence Alex is thinking a long
way ahead here. White's a1 Rook may be slow getting into the game but
Black's a8 Rook is in a similar state. Then again White can possibly double
Rooks on the d- file whereas the b6 Bishop means Black won't be doing the
same. 16&hellip;Nh5</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is not a blunder or an oversight. This is a deeply-considered positional
Pawn sacrifice. It's also a clear statement of &quot;I'm coming to get
you!&quot;</p>
<p>The main point is that it frees up the Black e7 Bishop to access the weak dark
squares in White's camp. There are other ways that Jessica could have played
the position but this is certainly one of the most interesting and direct!
Ironically it also reinforces the point that Alex did choose the right square
for his Rook earlier.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Personally, I don't think that Black has enough compensation for the Pawn
here, but I don't like this move. The Knight doesn't seem to do anything
on this square and it can't move from it either. There is a theory that
it's good to surround a King with pieces for defensive purposes, but I like
mine to be doing something, not just being there for show. 22. Nf2 and out to d3
is the better move.</p>

considered 23. Bxa5 snatching a second Pawn and asking Jessica to prove what
she has for them. White of course would have a Queenside majority and the a1
Rook in a prime place to help it advance. I like 23. Qc3 improving the Queen and
keeping the options open.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span style="display:flex;"><span>23...Bg3!?
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>An annoying move. It exploits the White Knight's lack of squares after 24.
Bxg3 hxg3, and it intends 24&hellip;h4 locking the Bishop in place and making it a
long-term asset.</p>
<p>I think Alex finds the right way to deal with this shortly, but I'm not sure
his next move is necessary. The immediate 24. Bd3 may be better and 24. Bc5 or
d4 may be improvements.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I'm not sure what this is meant to do. It's difficult to say that e8 is
a better square for this piece and shortly it leads to a critical decision for
Black. A much more natural move is 25&hellip;Qe5 improving the Queen and preventing
both Bd4 and Bc5 for White, and there's not much wrong with 25&hellip;Rad8
either.</p>

had ways of avoiding this inconvenience on move 25.</p>
<p>This is a critical moment. Jessica decides to surrender the Exchange as well,
but it's important to point out that her own DSB has left the board already.
In the resulting position she's replying very heavily on a breakthrough on
h3 and tactical tricks on the g1–a7 diagonal, but Alex's central control
should be enough to keep him ahead. However, from now on the Black Pawn on g3
takes on increasingly larger significance.</p>

could be a subtle mistake with some long-lasting consequences. This Bishop
should really be on f1 to give extra coverage to the h3 square. Deep Rybka also
says 29. Bf1 Bxh3 30. Qd2! followed by 31. Qxf4 will refute that tactic anyway.
Meanwhile the hemmed-in Rook on f8 isn't going anywhere.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In chess it is vital to be consistent. Both sides are attacking and this is no
time to defend meaningless Pawns. 36. R1d5! is the move to play. The difference
is that after 36&hellip;Rxh3 37. Rd8 there is no check on c5 and now 37&hellip;Qe6 38.
R5d6 runs the Queen out of squares from which it can defend the h3 Rook. This
difference will become apparent in the next note.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span style="display:flex;"><span>36...Qc5+??
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Missing a fleeting chance. Deep Rybka claims that after 36&hellip; Rxh3 Black is
winning!</p>
<p>The point is that for the Rook sacrificed Black has a fixed local superiority
near the White King in the form of the f4 and g3 Pawns. If they can co-operate
with other Black pieces then there are potential mating nets. The only White
units doing defensive work are the Queen and Bishop which are both badly
hampered by the local Pawn structure. Black's main route into the White King
position is via h3, but as White is protecting it with his Queen Black has to
take with his Rook then find some way to vertically back that up with his own
Queen, say via h8, and threaten &hellip;Rh1+ followed by a Queen mate on h2 or h3.</p>
<p>The difficulty for Black is that after 36&hellip;Rxh3 37. Rd8 cuts off the Queen from
h8. and there are limited squares on the c8-h3 diagonal from which her Majesty
can continue to support the h3 Rook. However, there is 37&hellip;Qc5+ and this is
where things get rather awkward for both humans and engines. Obviously 38. Kg2
is answered by an immediate mate with 38&hellip;Rh2, but both Rooks can interpose on
d4. 38. R1d4 is the better move - I'll explain why in a moment - after which
Black plays 38&hellip;Rh2 again. Now Black intends 39&hellip;Nc6 forking the Rooks and
allowing 40&hellip;Qh5 to support 41&hellip;Rh1 mate, so White's best is probably 39.
R8d5 - this option left open by interposing the hinder Rook. However, Black then
momentarily goes in reverse with 39&hellip;Qe7 threatening 40&hellip;Qh4 and White has no
effective parry to the mate in the long term.</p>
<p>This is a lot for any human in time-trouble to work out. The maneuver &hellip;Qc8-c5-
e7-h4 is hard to see. It was also a lot for the engine which changed its
evaluation
several times whilst working out the variations here, and I haven't even
given all the possible lines.</p>
<p>Basically &hellip;Rxh3 is a strategic must for Black so it should be played, whilst
&hellip;Qc5+ is a tactical resource so should be kept for an emergency. In the game
Black never gets to the chance to take on h3 again and that's the
title-deciding difference.</p>

intending
40. Qxf4 collapsing Black's Kingside is strong. The tempo gained for Bf1 to
defend h3 is very handy, and bear in mind White is a Rook up here so he can
comfortably afford to return an Exchange.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Black is now a whole tempo down on previous lines. As pointed out to the note at
White's 36th the difference is that 38&hellip;Rxh3 39. Rd8 Qe6 - no check on c5 -
40. R5d6 and the Queen runs out of squares on the c8-h3 diagonal.</p>
<p>Hence the Knight is really en prise and something has to be done about it.
Personally I would prefer 38&hellip;f6 to anchor the Knight and maintain control of
d7 thus preventing White's next which cuts off the Black Queen from h3.
However, 38&hellip;f6 39. Bxb5 Rxh3? is met by 40. Rd7+! severing said line anyway.</p>

with all manner of threats. Black needs a Queen check first on the a7-g1
diagonal to force Kg1–h1 g3-g2+ but the White Rooks cover all the squares.</p>
