<h1>The Rules for Tournament Play With And Between Blind Players</h1>
<h2 id="rules-adapted-for-blind-and-visually-impaired-people">Rules Adapted For Blind And Visually-impaired People</h2>
<h3 id="supplement-to-the-fide-laws-of-chess">SUPPLEMENT TO THE FIDE LAWS OF CHESS</h3>
<p>Competitive games between visually impaired and sighted players and
between visually impaired players</p>
<p>Tournament Directors shall have the power to adapt the following rules
according to local circumstances:</p>
<p>In competitive Chess between sighted and visually impaired players
(legally blind) either player may demand the use of two boards, the
sighted player using a normal board, the visually impaired player using
one specially constructed. The specially constructed board must meet the
following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>at least 20 by 20 centimetres</li>
<li>the black squares slightly raised</li>
<li>a securing aperture in each square</li>
<li>every piece provided with a peg that fits into the securing aperture</li>
<li>pieces of Staunton design, the black pieces being specially marked</li>
</ol>
<p>The following regulations shall govern play:</p>
<p>The moves shall be announced clearly, repeated by the opponent and
executed on his board. To make the announcement as clear as possible,
the use of the following names is suggested instead of the corresponding
letters, algebraic notation to be used:</p>
<p>A - Anna</p>
<p>B - Bella</p>
<p>C - Cesar</p>
<p>D - David</p>
<p>E - Eva</p>
<p>F - Felix</p>
<p>G - Gustav</p>
<p>H - Hector</p>
<p>Castling is announced, &quot;Lange Rochade&quot; (German for Long Castling) and
&quot;Kurze Rochade&quot; (German for Short Castling)</p>
<p>When promoting a Pawn the player must announce which piece is chosen</p>
<p>On the visually impaired player's board a piece shall be considered
&quot;touched&quot; when it has been taken out of the securing aperture.</p>
<p>A move shall be considered &quot;executed&quot; when:</p>
<p>a.  in the case of a capture, the captured piece has been removed from
the board of the player whose turn it is to move.
b.  a piece is placed into a different securing aperture.
c.  the move has been announced. Only then the opponent's clock shall
be started. As far as points 2 and 3 are concerned the normal rules
are valid for the sighted player.</p>
<p>A specially constructed Chess clock for the visually impaired shall be
admissible. It shall incorporate the following features:</p>
<p>a.  a dial fitted with reinforced hands, with every five minutes marked
by one raised dot, and every 15 minutes by two raised dots.
b.  a flag which can be easily felt. Care should be taken that the flag
is so arranged as to allow the player to feel the minute hand during
the last five minutes of the full hour.</p>
<p>The visually impaired player must keep score of the game in Braille or
longhand or record the moves on a tape recorder.</p>
<p>A slip of the tongue in the announcement of a move must be corrected
immediately and before the clock of the opponent is started.</p>
<p>If, during a game, different positions should arise on the two boards,
they must be corrected with the assistance of the Arbiter and by
consulting both players' game scores. If the two game scores correspond
with each other, the player who has written the correct move but
executed the wrong one must adjust his position to correspond with the
move on the game scores.</p>
<p>If, when such differences occur and the two game scores are found to
differ, the moves shall be retraced to the point where the two scores
agree and the Controller shall readjust the clocks accordingly.</p>
<p>The visually impaired player shall have the right to make use of an
assistant who shall have any or all of the following duties:</p>
<p>a.  make either player's move on the board of the opponent.
b.  announce the moves of both players.
c.  keep the game score of the visually impaired player and start his
opponent's clock (keeping rule 3 (c) in mind).
d.  inform the visually impaired player only at his request of the
numbers of moves completed and the time used up by both players.
e.  claim the game in cases where the time limit has been exceeded and
inform the Controller when the sighted player has touched one of his
pieces.
f.  carry out the necessary formalities in case the game is adjourned.</p>
<p>If the visually impaired player does not make use of an assistant, the
sighted player may make use of one who shall carry out the duties
mentioned under point 9 (a) and (b).</p>
<p>These rules were adopted at the IBCA Congress in Benidorm 1985 and
approved by the FIDE 1985 General Assembly.</p>
